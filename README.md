# 99-n-s

A Roblox game project built with Clean Architecture principles using Luau.

Generated by [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) 7.7.0-rc.1.

## Architecture

This project follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

- **Domain Layer**: Business logic and entities (Player, GameSession)
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Technical services (DIContainer, RemoteEventService)
- **Shared Code**: Code used by both client and server
- **Client/Server Layers**: Platform-specific implementations

## Prerequisites

- [Roblox Studio](https://create.roblox.com/)
- [Rojo](https://rojo.space/) 7.7.0+
- [Aftman](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/aftman) (optional, for tooling)
